- The board is divided into cells, with mines randomly distributed. 
- To win, you need to open all the cells. The number on a cell shows the number of mines adjacent to it.
- Using this information, you can determine cells that are safe, and cells that contain mines.
- Cells suspected of being mines can be marked with a flag using the right mouse button.
